1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position

We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].

We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:

position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.

class Solution {
    public int minCostToMoveChips(int[] position) {
        int odd=0;
        int even=0;
        for(int num: position){
            if(num%2==0) even++;
            else odd++;
        }

        return Math.min(odd, even);
    }
